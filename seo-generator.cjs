      <h1>About ShowPay</h1>
      <p>Showpay is a mobile-friendly web application designed for account holders who want to access their payment dashboard quickly and securely. The official <strong>ShowPay login</strong> is available at <strong>app-showpay.in</strong>, the only domain you should use to sign in to your Showpay account. This page explains what ShowPay offers, how the Showpay app works, and what to do if you need account assistance.</p>
      
      <h2>What is ShowPay?</h2>
      <p>Showpay—also written as "Show Pay" or searched as "Showpay"—is a web-based payment platform that gives registered users access to a personal account dashboard. Through the dashboard, users can view their account balance, access payment and wallet tools, review transaction history, and follow instructions provided for their account type. The platform is built to work on both desktop and mobile browsers, meaning you do not need to install a Showpay apk to use the core features.</p>

      <h2>How ShowPay account access works</h2>
      <p>To use the Show Pay Login, open the login page and enter the mobile number and password associated with your account. After a successful ShowPay login, the system may prompt you to enter a six-digit MPIN to confirm your identity before displaying your account dashboard. This two-step process helps protect your account from unauthorized access.</p>
      
      <h3>How to Use ShowPay Safely</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Always confirm the address bar shows <strong>app-showpay.in</strong> before entering any account details for your Showpay login.</li>
        <li>Never share your password, OTP, MPIN, or recovery code with anyone.</li>
        <li>If you forget your password, use the Forget Password link shown on the Show Pay Login page to start the account recovery process. OTPs expire quickly and are only valid for the specific action requested.</li>
        <li>Create a new, stronger password that is unique to Showpay.</li>
        <li>Avoid saving credentials in shared browsers or on devices you do not control.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What features are available in ShowPay?</h2>
      <p>The specific features available after login depend on your account type and the current platform configuration. Generally, Showpay accounts provide access to a payment dashboard showing account balance information, transaction options, and any deposit or withdrawal tools enabled for your account. Some accounts may have access to Showpay USDT cryptocurrency features, while others may show different payment methods. Always check the current options displayed inside your signed-in dashboard rather than relying on information from an older screenshot or message.</p>

      <h1>ShowPay App and APK Access</h1>
      <p>Many users search for a <strong>Showpay apk</strong> download to install the app on their Android phone. This page explains the safest way to access Showpay on mobile, why you should be careful with APK files from unknown sources, and how to use the official Showpay app without downloading any additional file.</p>
      
      <h2>The official Showpay mobile access method</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Showpay app</strong> is fully accessible through any current mobile browser. Open <strong>https://app-showpay.in/</strong> in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or any other browser installed on your Android or iOS device. The site automatically adjusts to fit your phone screen, providing a smooth, app-like experience without requiring an installation. Before entering any account details for a ShowPay login, confirm the address bar shows <strong>app-showpay.in</strong> and not a variation or look-alike domain.</p>
      <p>This approach is the recommended and verified method for accessing Showpay on a mobile device. Unlike an APK file you might receive through a message or find on a third-party website, the web app is always up to date and does not require device permissions beyond what your browser already has.</p>
      
      <h2>Adding Showpay to your phone home screen</h2>
      <p>If you want faster access to Showpay on your phone without going through your browser bookmarks each time, you can add the site to your home screen. This creates a shortcut that opens the web app in a full-screen view without browser toolbars. This is safer than installing a Showpay apk from an unknown source.</p>

      <h2>Risks of unverified Showpay apk files</h2>
      <p>An APK file is an Android application package. While APKs are a legitimate way to distribute Android apps, files from unofficial sources carry serious risks. An APK claiming to be a Show Pay download could:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Request permissions to access your contacts, camera, microphone, storage, or SMS messages unnecessarily.</li>
        <li>Contain malware designed to steal your Show Pay Login credentials, banking details, or other personal information.</li>
        <li>Display a fake Showpay interface that collects your mobile number, password, and MPIN and sends them to an attacker.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For more details, read the <a href="/showpay-usdt.html">Showpay USDT guide</a>, or go to the <a href="/">Showpay login</a>.</p>

      <h1>ShowPay USDT Guide</h1>
      <p>This comprehensive guide explains every check you should make before and after using a <strong>Showpay USDT</strong> feature available in your Showpay account. USDT (Tether) is a stablecoin that can be transferred on multiple blockchain networks. Because each network has different addresses, fees, and confirmation times, reading these checks carefully before making a transfer can prevent mistakes that are difficult or impossible to reverse.</p>
      
      <h2>How to Deposit on Showpay</h2>
      <p>Different users may see different deposit methods in their dashboards. Whether it is a bank transfer, UPI, or crypto, the following applies to all Showpay deposit methods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open <a href="/">app-showpay.in</a> and sign in using your Showpay login. Complete the MPIN step if prompted.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the deposit section of your dashboard. Only use a deposit option if it is currently displayed and active for your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Verify all details before confirming:</strong> Check the recipient details, minimum deposit amount, fees, and expiry time.</li>
        <li>Save your confirmation receipt or transaction ID (TXID). This reference is essential if you need to follow up on the deposit status.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step-by-step: How to deposit USDT on ShowPay</h2>
      <p>Depositing <strong>Showpay USDT</strong> requires additional network and address verification:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Note the network name shown on the Showpay deposit screen (e.g., TRC-20, ERC-20). In your sending wallet, choose the exact same network. A network mismatch can cause permanent loss of funds.</li>
        <li>Copy the destination wallet address from your Showpay deposit screen. Compare the full address—beginning, middle, and end—between what your wallet shows and what the Showpay screen shows.</li>
        <li>Check that your amount meets the minimum shown on the deposit screen, review fees, and confirm the transfer.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Checking Showpay USDT transaction status</h2>
      <p>Processing time can vary by network activity and the number of blockchain confirmations required by Showpay. After sending, use the public TXID from your wallet to look up the transaction on a blockchain explorer matching the network you used. Wait for the required confirmations before concluding there is a problem.</p>
      <p>If a Showpay USDT transaction is pending longer than expected, verify the TXID on an explorer, check that the destination address matched exactly, and confirm both sides used the same network. Do not send a second transfer until the first one is confirmed or rejected.</p>

      <p>For any Showpay transaction question, keep your public transaction ID ready. A genuine support process will never ask you to share your current password, MPIN, or OTP. It will not ask you to send funds to a new address to verify your account or unlock a feature.</p>
